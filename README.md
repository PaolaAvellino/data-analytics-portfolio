Hi there! 👋 

I'm **Paola Avellino**, currently pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science, with a strong interest in turning raw data into valuable insights. I'm building this portfolio to showcase what I'm learning and how I apply it through real-world projects.

Even though I'm transitioning from a background in international business and customs analysis, I bring a sharp analytical mindset, a love for problem-solving, and growing skills in tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, and R.
